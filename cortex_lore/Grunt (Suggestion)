Norgvun proved to be one of the most open battlefields to date.  
Alecto, seeking to take and hold the region before her adversaries, was tasked with quickly scouting, taking, and holding the territory.
Enter the Grunt, so named for its role as a well-rounded backbone unit for light engagements and swarm tactics.
It was cheap, had a remarkable weapon range for its class and size, and was a match in maneuverability for some of Armada's fastest mechs.

Alecto was able to utilize this frightening unit to devastating effect in the early engagements on Norgvun, 
rapidly surrounding and overpowering static emplacements and many of Armada's slower tanks. 
Before long, she was able to replace every lost Grunt with another two or three, 
granting her a numbers advantage against an ill prepared Armada front, and ultimately, solid initial control of the Norgvun battlefront.

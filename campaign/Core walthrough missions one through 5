CORE CAMPAIGN prototype 2

# INTRO WALL OF TEXT #
so after several issues where pointed out in the [BAR CAMPAIGN PROTOYPE](https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/lore/pull/1). If the link is broken then the file has either been merged or deleted. PING ME IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A COPY OF IT @drivver44 on the BAR DISCORD. WARNING , its  poorly formated.
<br></br>
so what is campaign prototype and what what are the dependencies/features.  

## dependancies ##
1. triggers 
1. unit trackers
1. AI requirements 

First triggers. they are needed for formating and progressing a mission in a traditional multi stage manner. This helps reduce the mission count and increase the potential of what a mission can include inside of itself. Second unit trackers and what do i mean by those. tracking unit status's are needed for having unique mission types. Escort,Evac, and protection missions require that a units stats are tracked. Bonus objectives would also be massive here (example lose only X amount of units).

<br></br>

## features ##

1. multi stage missions 
2. diverse mission types 
3. a fairly strong comprehensive overview of the faction
4. Lore  <yes make that a seeling point pls do. all the lore. all of it. some youtube channel will make vids on lore dont worry. >
5. hidden missions because players dont finish them the way **they** were intended to be finished





<br></br>

## map requirements ##
some missions will naturally require a unique map made
if a mission specific map is required it will be listed as 
### MAP NEEDED ###
* LIST OF ITEM NEEDED

then it will go on to mission briefing and starting trigger




<br></br>

## AI requirements ##
some maps will require unique behavoir on the ai 
things such as 
* limited unit count
* limited access to units 
* limited special units 
* able to command unit to go from point A to B 

<br></br>

some missions will inherintly require an ai to move transports/special units around 



<br></br>

## SCORING ##

* time 
* metal produced 
* energy produced

Scoring as a factor will change on mission type. 
For example a nobuild mission will have sigificant time factoring but no resourcing factor (metal produced or energy produced). The upsides for such factoring is to more accuratly guage each mission. Time will always be a negative factor for the player. Metal and Engergy produced will either have a 0 factor or a negative factor. Instead of being the normal you start at X score, the player score starts at 0 and increases overtime. The higher the player's score is the worse that they did during the mission (lower is better). <everything is just persective  up or down doesnt matter> 

### notes ###

next topic because this is going to be a discussion. (zow and bel already had this a few times.)
There will be a tutorial series of missions outside of either campaign that will go over the very fundamental basics of an RTS. The reason for doing so is simple, what will be conveyed in the campaign is somewhat relliant on knowing the fundamentals of an rts. 
<br></br>
Each mission will have a play out section as to how the mission would work. mission Briefing will have WIN/LOSS/BONUS objectives listed.The format is **Mission Briefing**,**STARTING TRIGGER**, **MIDDLE TRIGGER**(possibly with numbers), **ENDING TRIGGER**. This is an effort to show how a mission would progress. If triggers are not possible, then consider them as to how each mission would proceed in a single stage. 
<br></br>
Units when given/unlocked will have a link on the name for what the unit is(we all got screwed by the renaming effort :D). This is to also note how the mission was conceptually put together. 
<br></br>
# lessons learned in the ashes 3.0 balance update #
most of you would be wondering why I would include this and normally think that this is a waste of time. I assure you I'll keep this short on the list
<br></br>
* when making balance changes remember that there are people love to play the campaign more than multiplayer
* when missions were made they were made with the timestamped balance that they occured around 
<br></br>
As such when considering balance changes, it is heavily reccomended that you keep a campaign balance and a multiplayer balance. This is to help minimize balance changes from severely affecting how a mission plays out, or making such missions a joke/nightmare to play.
